# FUTURE_ML_02
Machine learning–based customer churn prediction system with classification models and business insights.
# Customer Churn Prediction System

This project focuses on building a machine learning system to predict
customer churn — identifying customers who are likely to stop using a service.
The project is based on real-world telecom/banking churn data and aims to
support business decision-making through data-driven insights.

## 📁 Dataset
- Customer Churn Dataset (Telecom / Banking)
- Includes customer demographics, services used, contract details,
  payment methods, and churn status.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. Load and explore customer churn dataset
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature engineering and encoding
4. Train-test split
5. Build classification models:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost
6. Evaluate model using:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC-AUC
7. Analyze churn probabilities and key drivers

## 📓 Notebook
- `churn_prediction.ipynb`
- Contains complete preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and visualization steps

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
